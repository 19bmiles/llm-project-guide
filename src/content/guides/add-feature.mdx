# Adding Features to Existing Projects

This guide will help you integrate new features into an existing codebase using AI assistance.

## Understanding the Codebase

Before adding a new feature, it's important to understand the existing codebase:

1. Review the project structure
2. Identify key components and their relationships
3. Understand the data flow
4. Identify potential integration points

## Code Example: Feature Integration

```typescript
// Example of integrating a new feature into an existing component
import { useState } from 'react'
import { ExistingComponent } from '@/components/ExistingComponent'

export function EnhancedComponent() {
  const [newFeatureState, setNewFeatureState] = useState(false)
  
  return (
    <div>
      <ExistingComponent />
      <div className="mt-4 p-4 border rounded">
        <h3>New Feature</h3>
        <button 
          onClick={() => setNewFeatureState(!newFeatureState)}
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
        >
          Toggle Feature
        </button>
        {newFeatureState && (
          <div className="mt-2">
            <p>New feature content</p>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Testing Your Integration

After adding a new feature, it's important to test it thoroughly:

1. Write unit tests for the new functionality
2. Test integration with existing components
3. Verify that existing functionality still works
4. Perform end-to-end testing
