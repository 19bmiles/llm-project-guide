# Green-Field Development with AI

This guide will walk you through the process of starting a new project from scratch using AI assistance.

## Phase 0: Project Setup

The first phase involves setting up your development environment:

1. Install Node.js and pnpm
2. Create a new Next.js project
3. Configure TypeScript and linting
4. Set up version control

## Code Example: Project Initialization

```bash
# Create a new Next.js project
pnpm create next-app@latest my-project \
  --ts --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir

# Navigate to the project directory
cd my-project

# Install additional dependencies
pnpm add -D prettier eslint-config-prettier
```

## Phase 1: Design System

Next, we'll set up a design system:

1. Configure Tailwind CSS
2. Set up a component library
3. Implement dark mode
4. Create reusable UI components
