# Project Vision

HackAIâ€™s mission is to **teach developers how to partner with LLMs** (e.g., Cursor Agent) while shipping real code.  
Version 2 focuses on two workflows:

1. **Green-field** â€“ start a brand-new webapp from scratch.  
2. **Add a Feature** â€“ integrate a cross-cutting capability into a mature monorepo SaaS.

> Future versions will add interactive wizards to automate scoping, prompt generation, and checklists.

## Information Architecture (MVP)

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/` | Hero, value prop, quick links |
| `/guides/green-field` | Step-by-step build of **this** site |
| `/guides/add-feature` | Step-by-step feature integration |
| `/resources/prompt-library` | Copy-paste prompt catalog |
| `/about` | HackAI background & contribution guide |

## Out-of-Scope (MVP)

- Component playgrounds (Storybook)  
- End-to-end tests (Cypress / Playwright)  
- Database integration or backend APIs  

## Future Automation Hooks

| Hook | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ðŸ”® Wizard Step 1 | Capture project description and goals |
| ðŸ”® Wizard Step 3 | Auto-generate supplemental docs (coding standards, styling guide) |
| ðŸ”® Wizard Step 6 | Batch-execute Cursor agent phases |

# Phase-by-Phase Plan

> Each phase lists: *goal â€¢ effort â€¢ exact prompts â€¢ commit template*.  
> Printable checklists live in `/static/pdfs/`.

## Phase 0 â€” Scaffold & Hardening   (~2 hrs)

### Goal
Create a clean Next 19 + React 15 base with strict linting & formatting.

### Prompts
```txt
prompt: scaffold_project

Act as a lead engineer. Guide me through:
1. Running pnpm create next-app with Tailwind & TS
2. Removing boilerplate
3. Enabling strict TS + Prettier + ESLint
4. Setting up Husky with commitlint
Return shell commands only.
